  All other styles that were previously in this file have been moved to `index.css`.
  This includes:
  - body and #root styling
  - theme-specific colors and backgrounds
  - responsive media queries
  - global button and form styles
  - .glass and .card generic styles

  This separation makes the styling more organized and easier to maintain.
